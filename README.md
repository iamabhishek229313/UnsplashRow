## What asked? What done!

#### Required Features:
- [x] The images should be fetched from the Unsplash API in real time.
- [x] There should be two tabs: Discover and Bookmarks
- [x] The Discover tab should have an infinite pagination view of all images fetched from the API
- [x] Upon clicking any image in the Discover tab, a separate view should open up with only
      that image. It should also have the author of the image.
- [x] A button on this page, which takes the user to the original picture on Unsplash is a plus.

- [x] There should also be an option to bookmark the images and store the bookmarks.
- [x] The bookmarked images should be visible in the Bookmarks tab
- [x] The bookmarked images should be available to the user even on successive app launches.
- [x] There should also be an option to search for specific images by hitting the relevant API
endpoint. Users may also bookmark any image that appears in a search result.
#### Optional Features:
- [x] Implement caching of images in a way that the user can still see the bookmarked images
normally, even if the device is offline.
- [x] Add a placeholder image, to appear while the image is being fetched from the network,
or if thereâ€™s an error in fetching the images.
